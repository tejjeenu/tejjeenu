# 👋 Hi I’m Tej

I'm an AI and Computer Science student at the University of Birmingham, passionate about building ML-powered full-stack applications and always exploring new ways to learn, grow, and create.


## 🔧 What I've Built

- AI-powered productivity / learning tools — smart to-do apps, habit trackers, study-assistants.  
- Student-focused utilities — e.g. PDF → extracted notes → Anki-ready flashcard generators (Python + automation).  
- ML / data-driven utilities & small experiments — chatbots, data-processing pipelines, simple AI prototypes.  


## 🌱 What I’m Working On / Learning / Improving  

- Making my profile & projects more polished — clean profile visuals, better-documented repos, and maybe a portfolio site + live demos.  
- Writing **clean, maintainable, testable code** — using good architecture, modularity, and code hygiene so projects remain scalable.  
- Building full-stack + ML/data apps: cleaned data → model training → deployable APIs or webapps.  
- Improving infra and deployment skills — using Docker / containerisation, real databases (PostgreSQL/SupaBase), and proper project setup.  
- Experimenting with **different tech stacks & tools** — backend, frontend, data, ML, integrations — to build versatile and production-ready projects.  


## 🚀 What I Want to Build / Try Soon  

- ML-powered APIs / services (e.g. data-cleaning + prediction tools)  
- Projects that process messy datasets → clean → train → deploy, exposing results via UI or API  
- Practical productivity / data-processing / automation apps mixing ML + real-world usefulness  
- A neat online portfolio / showcase with live demos — so people don’t just read code, they *see it working*
