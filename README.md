# 👋 Hey there — I’m Tej

I build full-stack applications and machine-learning tools to solve real-world problems — especially those around learning, productivity, and wellbeing.  
I’m passionate about using AI and software to make everyday life easier, smarter, and more meaningful.

## 🔧 What I Build / What I’m Good At

- **AI-powered productivity apps** — habit-centred tools, to-do apps with smart suggestions, small utilities to boost workflow.  
- **Student-focused study tools** — e.g. Python apps that extract important points from PDFs and generate Anki-ready flashcards (helpful for studying / revision).  
- **ML / data-driven utilities & experimentation** — small AI/ML tools, data-processing scripts, prototypes exploring computer vision / automation.

## 🌱 What I’m Working On — My Improvement Roadmap

I believe in continuous learning and growth. Here are the areas I’m currently focusing on improving:

**🔹 Portfolio & Online Presence**  
- Add **live demos / deployable versions** for projects (web apps, APIs, data tools), so people can use them directly — not just browse code.  

**🔹 Code Quality & Project Engineering**  
- Adopt **clean architecture / OOP** for better readability, maintainability, and scalable design.  
- Add **proper testing** (unit / integration) to new and existing projects — makes code more robust and easier to maintain.  
- Explore different databases (e.g. PostgreSQL, Supabase) depending on project needs — not just defaulting to lightweight storage.  
- Use **containerization** (e.g. Docker) when appropriate — makes deployment and environment setup easier and more reproducible.  

**🔹 Technical Focus Areas / Project Ideas**  
- Build and deploy **ML-powered APIs** — e.g. train a model and serve it as an endpoint for real-world apps.  
- Work with **messy / real-world datasets**: data cleaning, transformation, building pipelines, then training models and exposing predictions via apps or APIs.  
- Develop **productivity tools using GenAI / ML** — practical apps to automate or simplify tasks (data processing, note-taking, automation).  
- Create **data-cleaning / processing automation tools** — for messy datasets, repeated workflows, data extraction/normalization, etc.

## 🚀 Working Style & Mindset

I’m constantly exploring, learning, iterating. I welcome feedback, aim for clean, maintainable code, and strive to build projects that do more than “just work” — projects that are useful, usable, and meaningful.  

> “Every project is a chance to learn, improve, and grow.”  

Looking forward to sharing more.
