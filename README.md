# 👋 Hey — I’m Tej Jeenu

I love building ML-powered full-stack apps and I’m always exploring ways to learn, grow and build better.  

---

## 🔧 What I Build, & What I’m Good At

- 🧠 AI-powered productivity / learning tools — smart to-do apps, habit trackers, study-assistants.  
- 📚 Student-focused utilities — e.g. PDF → extracted notes → Anki-ready flashcard generators (Python + automation).  
- 💡 ML / data-driven utilities & small experiments — chatbots, data-processing pipelines, simple AI prototypes.

## 🌱 What I’m Working On / Learning / Improving  

- 🛠️ Making my profile & projects more polished — clean profile visuals, better-documented repos, and maybe a portfolio site + live demos.  
- 🧩 Writing **clean, maintainable, testable code** — using good architecture, modularity, and code hygiene so projects remain scalable.  
- 🧪 Building full-stack + ML/data apps: cleaned data → model training → deployable APIs or webapps.  
- 🐳 Improving infra and deployment skills — using Docker / containerisation, real databases (PostgreSQL/SupaBase), and proper project setup.  
- 🔁 Experimenting with **different tech stacks & tools** — backend, frontend, data, ML, integrations — to build versatile and production-ready projects.

## 🚀 What I Want to Build / Try Soon  

- 🧠 ML-powered APIs / services (e.g. intelligent note-taking assistant, data-cleaning + prediction tools)  
- 📊 Projects that process messy datasets → clean → train → deploy, exposing results via UI or API  
- 🛠️ Practical productivity / data-processing / automation apps mixing ML + real-world usefulness  
- 📁 A neat online portfolio / showcase with live demos — so people don’t just read code, they *see it working*
